# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If you just created something, wait at least a couple of weeks before submitting.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant section.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.

## Module evaluation criteria

This a curated list. I wish to include only module that are well-crafted, and that follows the UNIX philosoply of doing one single thing well. 
Please ensure that modules you submit meet at least following criterias:

- They are well tested.
- Their purpose is clearly specified in README file.
- They focus on a single, well defined purpose.
- Their code is clean and understandable.
- Their code is in javascript (no coffescript, typescript or other)

Since modules in NPM are a bazillion, in case one or more modules share the same purpose, these are 
some additional criterias we'll use to choose one:

- lean dependencies
- number of deep-dependent modules on npm
- number of star on GH or NPM
- number of issues and pull requests on GH


Thank you for your suggestions!
